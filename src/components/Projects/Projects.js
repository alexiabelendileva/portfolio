          Hi! I'm Belen, a passionate about technology, learning, art and
          design. One of my goals is to grow professionally with all my efforts
          as a Front-End Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I seek to be in constant training and put what I've learned into
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>I'm responsible, empathetic, persevering, dedicated and curious.</p>
        <p>
          I would love to be part of projects that allows me to develop myself
          as a professional and improve my performance, as well as collaborate
          with a work team to meet objectives and continue polishing my soft
          skills.
        </p>
